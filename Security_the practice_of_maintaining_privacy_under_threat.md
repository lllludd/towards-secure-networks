## Privacy?

We have an intuition that we ought to be able to choose with whom we share
information about ourselves and, further, that we ought to be able to determine
how others might use information about us.

That is, we have an intuition that privacy is a good. We expect that others will not open and read our personal mail, that a journal left in the kitchen will be left unmollested and that our sexy selfies will be seen only by the person to whom they were sent.

We hope to have consented to information about us being gathered and held by the
government, businesses or institutions and have expectations about the ways in
which it will be used. We do not expect a prospective employer to be furnished
with our medical or mental health health records as a matter of course.

This is not the case, of course. So privacy is a good that must be maintained. There is a need for security. **Security is the practice of maintaining privacy in contexts in which it is under threat.**
