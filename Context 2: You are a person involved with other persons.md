## Context 2: You are a person involved with other persons and together you act to resist power and create counterpower


#### Our actions affect each other.
- The differences that context 2 bring from context one are:
  - We may come under targeted attack from Police.
  - Our actions now affect each other.
  - It is almost impossible to hide a network in the context of metadata, so we need to be careful what we give up in addition.
  - Good security culture means we shouldn't know what each other are trying to hide. We need broad understandings of, what is safe, expected from one another, and what is unacceptable.
  - Most attempts at security in activist circles are little more than snitch-jacketing and in-groups.
  - We need to agree on how we are to be safe so we can be dangerous together


#### It is almost impossible to hide Networks.
- Under the provisions of mandatory data retention it is almost impossible to hide a network. To do so would require this:
  - No phones, they could not be brought to meetings, actions or social events, they also could not be turned off at the same time or unused for the same time as this would create a negative pattern.
  - No group messaging, text messaging or emailing on known emails. This includes encrypted messaging apps.
  - No digital transactions in similar areas.
  - Avoid areas that have cameras when together.
  - All communication through Vpns, Tor or i2p, using unconnected encrypted emails, encrypted IM or Ricochet.


  - Needless to say this profoundly inconvient. It is not practical. Not sustainable. Not able to grow in number or capacity without great inconvience and paranoia.

#### Behavioural Aspects of Security.
- When we think of security our minds drift to cryptography and clandestine meetings, hackers and agents, dramatics. Yet the reality is that it is often a non-action that is most secure. Not sending messages, not posting on social media, not talking about what should be kept secret. Even indirect bragging is bragging. All information given regardless or it being peripheral is information.
- Security might look like going to the beach without phones, to chat to make decision about what needs to be decided. There is nothing untowards, or unexpected. There are no negative or positive patterns in data created. It is a regular thing to do.


### Case studies:
##### Using the internets to organise dissent:

  - Example 1:  In the lead up to their court case an activist from the Beeliar campaign was given DVD's that contained 4 months of recording of their facebook feed as disclosure of evidence that the state was using. They had intentionally left their feed public in attempts to propagandize. This is a classic example of the use of Facebook for intelligence gathering. There are sophisticated programs that are able to perform this kind of monitoring of Facebook.
  - Occurring similtaneously is the use, by far-right trolls and cops, of fake Facebook profiles that can be used to get inside closed or private groups and profiles. They can then be devisive in debate, flood communication or simply observe.


  - Example 2: Recently WACA used a web page that only configured for HTTP web browsing to advertise their "Disrupt 2017" campaign. After the campaign was launched stories and accounts started circulating about people who had signed up to the Disrupt 2017 form being visited by the police. What is not clear from this is how the police found out these peoples identities. What is known is that HTTP sends information in plain text. Meaning all of the information being sent between the websever and client was accessable to the ISP's and anyone watching the traffic coming out of the WACA server. Coincidence? I think not.


  - Example 3: On January 20th of 2017 230 people were mass-arrested using a police tactic known as 'kettling', without order being given to disperse. 214 people were charged with around 6 felony charges each and each face a maximun of 60 years in prison each.  This is an attempt at establishing legal precedent that criminalizes people for being present at the scene of a crime. All 214 people are being charged with breaking 5 windows etc. A website was established prior to January 20th called "disruptj20.com". In August 2017 the US department of Justice subpoened the information for all 1.3 million visitors to the disruptj20.com website. They also sort names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and other information about the owners and subscribers of the website disruptj20.com. This is an example of where online information caches have been used to attempt to reinforce conspiracy and arbitary felony charges. The trials are currently ongoing. This example is also from the states and should be read as such.
  (as a side note disruptj20.com also only supports the http protocol)


#### Surveillance Operations, Metadata and Targeted Policing:
- Example 4: During the shark cull campaign a raid on an activist compound around Fremantle lead the fisheries department in conjunction with the state cops to seize several computers, cameras, video cameras and other data storage (as well as boats and other gear). Due to the political devisiveness of the issue of the shark cull in state politics no one was charged until the statute of limitations has almost expired. At which point a wide range of heavy charges were places on the activists involved and incrimminated by the evidence seized. This stands as an example of how data security is essential especially when documenting illegal activity for propaganda purposes. It is unclear what other evidence the state had, and if charges would have been layed regardless. Digital Evidence can be protected by encryting the data, the devices that it is stored on and using strong passwords. Plain text versions of the data must also be deleted.

- Example 5: Operation 8 was a police Operation in New Zealand that in October 2007 saw the arrest and attempted charging of 17 Maori Sovereignty Activist and Anarchists under New Zealand anti-terror laws. The charges under the terror legislation were eventually dropped and 5 defendants were charged under fire arms offences. Operation 8 as a police investigation lasted several years with evidence still being collected up until 2012 when the defendants went to court.  The raids were conducted along paramilitary lines and drew heavy criticism. The deposition of the police included cherry picked quotes from drunk activists talking about "assassinating President Bush" by catapulting a bus onto him. The fact the activists were drunk, were talking shit and had choosen the method of death by bus catapult was left out of the deposition. Eventually the activists on firearm charges were found guilty with prison sentences ranging up to 9 months in prison. The raids had devestating effect upon New Zealand activist circles. It is worth looking into the Tuheo claims and background to the police investigation.


- Example 6: Pax was a portland based anarchist who was charged with 36 felony charges relating to property destruction of a bank. They practiced security culture, used device and message encryption, covered their face during illegal activity, didn't take their phone to actions and still got caught. Here is how: They wore a hoody and bandana instead of a balaclava meaning their forehead was 'identifiable'. ATM's have super high quality cameras and can be used to accurately determine physical characteristics such as height, weight etc. There was video footage proving both the perpertrator and Pax to be left handed. Pax owned clothes that had distinct characterists, sleeve flaps, white belt etc that matched that of the perpertrator. Their clothes were form fitting and betrayed their body type. While Pax's phone use didn't directly incrimminate them, their phone showed heavy encrypted message use before the attack, was turned off, and then heavy use just after the attack. At the end of it the police can draw a series of similarities and it is enough to charge and in the end convict.  


**TAKE HOME LESSONS**
- Example 1: We can protect ourselves by limiting the information we make public, being mindful of the ways we make it public, being careful with our privacy settings and who we allow access to our profiles.
- Example 2: We can protect ourselves by obfuscating our identity online, using VPN's and/or Tor. We need to understand the ways we send data online, and that how we send it exposes it to different risks.
- Example 3: Putting information online exposes us to certain risks! Accessing certain information online exposes us to certain risks. Especially in the context of conspiracyesque trials. We need to be careful of how we make information public, what information is linked to us personally and if need be hide our attachment to data we publish. We also need to obfuscate our identity online. All of this can be done through a combination of VPN's and Tor. This is much harder then just browsing anonymously.
- Example 4: We can protect ourselves by protecting our data! Especially data that is incriminating!! We can protect our data through the use of strong encryption and strong passwords. We do not always know what data is incriminating and as a result should use strong encryption routinely.
- Example 5: We learn that under sustained politically motivated police surveillance nothing is taken in good faith. This investigation was a result of the structure of the police and the need for them to find a 'political other' to justify their funding and existence. We need to be careful of what we say and the actions that expose us to greater police scrutiny, but also if cops look hard enough take our statements out of context and allege criminal conspiracy based of thin evidence we are going to be in trouble regardless of our attempts at safety and privacy.
- Example 6: Data is found in many forms. There is some data we can not control, negative data is still incriminating. How we perform certain action is deeply programed and can form a pattern. This is not our political context. But is a great example of how data and information security is not all digital but also behavioural.


### Tin hat section:

#### Metadata & Police:
- Metadata was accessed 332,639 times last year (2016):
These are the figures for some domestic agencies:
- 2013-14
  - VIC police:62,737
  - WA police: 27,315
  - SA: 1556
  - Federal police: 25,726 last year (110,225 in last 5 years)
  - NT police: 15,000 requests in the last 5 years.

- In 2016 there were 61 agencies that had so far been classified as law-enforcement agencies and granted access to metadata.


  - Currently there is moves to allow access to metadata in civil cases aswell. Is already permitted to be used in some civil cases. With specific intentions for its use around Piracy.

#### ASIO Powers:
  - "The amendment would enable ASIO to use a third party computer or ‘communication in transit’ in order to access data held on a target computer. If necessary to achieve the purpose, ASIO would also be able to add, copy, delete or alter data on the third party computer or communication in transit,"
  Content on a third party system would not be accessed without a telecommunications interception warrant, according to the department.
  The bill also modernises the definition of "computer" in the ASIO Act, changing it to "one or more computers", "one or more computer systems", "one or more computer networks", or "any combination of the above".
  - "[F]or a warrant to be issued there needs to be ‘reasonable grounds’ for believing that access by ASIO to data in the specified computer will ‘substantially assist the collection of intelligence … in respect of a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security’
  - Prison term for journalists, whistleblowers and even unknowningly sharing sensitive data, for withholding you password, for sharing
  - indemnity from civil and criminal prosecution for asio agents.
