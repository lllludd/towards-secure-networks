## Context 2: You are a person involved with other persons and together you act to resist power and create counterpower


#### Our actions affect each other.
- The differences that context 2 bring from context one are:
  - We may come under targeted attack from Police.
  - Our actions now affect each other.
  - It is almost impossible to hide a network in the context of metadata, so we need to be careful what we give up in addition.
  - Good security culture means we shouldn't know what each other are trying to hide. We need broad understandings of what is safe, expected from one another and unacceptable.
  - Most attempts at security in activist circles are little more than snitch-jacketing and in-groups.
  - We need to be safe so we can be dangerous together


#### It is almost impossible to hide Networks.
- Under the provisions of mandatory data retention it is almost impossible to hide a network. To do so would require this:
  - No phones, they could not be brought to meetings, actions or social events, they also could not be turned off at the same time or unused for the same time as this would create a negative pattern.
  - No group messaging, text messaging or emailing on known emails. This includes encrypted messaging apps.
  - No digital transactions in similar areas.
  - Avoid areas that have cameras when together.
  - All communication through Vpns and Tor, using unconnected encrypted emails, encrypted IM or Ricochet.


  - Needless to say this is not practical. Not sustainable. Not able to grow in number or capacity without great inconvience and paranoia.

### Case studies:
##### Using the internets to organise dissent:
  - Facebook Surveillance from Beeliar


  - Signing up to Disrupt WACA
    - HTTP? come on!
    - police visits

### Surveillance Operations, Metadata and Targeted Policing:
- Forest Rescue, the Shark Cull and information security.


- Operation 8. When drunk anarchists are seen as assassins.


- Pax the heavily policed individual who got got.


#### Tin hat section:

#### Metadata & Police:
- Number of times Metadata was accessed last year:
  - 104,000 NSW police
  - 64,000 VIC police
  - 23,000 by federal police.


  - Currently there is moves to allow access to metadata in civil cases aswell. Is already permitted to be used in some civil cases. With specific intentions for its use around Piracy.

#### ASIO Powers:
  - "The amendment would enable ASIO to use a third party computer or ‘communication in transit’ in order to access data held on a target computer. If necessary to achieve the purpose, ASIO would also be able to add, copy, delete or alter data on the third party computer or communication in transit,"
  Content on a third party system would not be accessed without a telecommunications interception warrant, according to the department.
  The bill also modernises the definition of "computer" in the ASIO Act, changing it to "one or more computers", "one or more computer systems", "one or more computer networks", or "any combination of the above".
  - "[F]or a warrant to be issued there needs to be ‘reasonable grounds’ for believing that access by ASIO to data in the specified computer will ‘substantially assist the collection of intelligence … in respect of a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security’
  - Prison term for journalists, whistleblowers and even unknowningly sharing sensitive data, for withholding you password, for sharing
  - indemnity from civil and criminal prosecution for asio agents.
  - only need warrants for journalists.
