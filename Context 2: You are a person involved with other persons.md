## Context 2: You are a person involved with other persons and together you act to resist power and create counterpower


#### Our actions affect each other.
- The differences that context 2 bring from context one are:
  - We may come under targeted attack from Police.
  - Our actions now affect each other.
  - It is almost impossible to hide a network in the context of metadata, so we need to be careful what we give up in addition.
  - Good security culture means we shouldn't know what each other are trying to hide. We need broad understandings of what is safe, expected from one another, and what is unacceptable.
  - Most attempts at security in activist circles are little more than snitch-jacketing and in-groups.
  - We need to be agree on how we are to be safe so we can be dangerous together


#### It is almost impossible to hide Networks.
- Under the provisions of mandatory data retention it is almost impossible to hide a network. To do so would require this:
  - No phones, they could not be brought to meetings, actions or social events, they also could not be turned off at the same time or unused for the same time as this would create a negative pattern.
  - No group messaging, text messaging or emailing on known emails. This includes encrypted messaging apps.
  - No digital transactions in similar areas.
  - Avoid areas that have cameras when together.
  - All communication through Vpns and Tor, using unconnected encrypted emails, encrypted IM or Ricochet.


  - Needless to say this is not practical. Not sustainable. Not able to grow in number or capacity without great inconvience and paranoia.


### Case studies:
##### Using the internets to organise dissent:
- Facebook Surveillance from Beeliar
  -  At trial an activist from the Beeliar campaign was handed DVD's that contained 4 months of recording of their facebook feed. They had intentionally left their feed public in attempts to propagandize. This is a classic example of the use of Facebook for intelligence gathering. There are sophisticated programs that are able to perform this kind of monitoring of Facebook.

### Tin hat section:

#### Metadata & Police:

#### ASIO Powers:
  - "The amendment would enable ASIO to use a third party computer or ‘communication in transit’ in order to access data held on a target computer. If necessary to achieve the purpose, ASIO would also be able to add, copy, delete or alter data on the third party computer or communication in transit,"
  Content on a third party system would not be accessed without a telecommunications interception warrant, according to the department.
  The bill also modernises the definition of "computer" in the ASIO Act, changing it to "one or more computers", "one or more computer systems", "one or more computer networks", or "any combination of the above".
  - "[F]or a warrant to be issued there needs to be ‘reasonable grounds’ for believing that access by ASIO to data in the specified computer will ‘substantially assist the collection of intelligence … in respect of a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security’
  - Prison term for journalists, whistleblowers and even unknowningly sharing sensitive data, for withholding you password, for sharing
  - indemnity from civil and criminal prosecution for asio agents.
  - only need warrants for journalists.
