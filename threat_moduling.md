## Threat Moduling.

#### A module of trade offs.
- Security and inconvience exist on a continuum.
- Technologies and tactics that attempt to achieve the highest level of security are profoundly inconvient. It is not just a matter of the tools being hard to use, the technologies being complex and esoteric, but also it is also a matter of behavioural requirements that are inconvient.
- As a result we have to make decisions about how and when we decide to trade security for convience or inconvience for more security.
- A further continuum is the relation between security and complexity. The more complex a system, the greater the number of interacting and dependant parts the more difficult it is to ensure a secure system.

#### How do we make these decisions?
-Many threat modules pose several focus question to help us make these decisions.
  - What do you want to protect?
  - Who do you need to protect it from?
  - What are the consequences if you fail to protect it?
  - How likely is it you need to protect it?
  - How much inconvience are you willing to go through to protect it?


- If we can answer these questions then we can develop a risk analysis that facilitates our decisions.
- Every individual, group or organizations will have a different threat module and as a result different security requirements. This will help make decisions around tool and technologies that will be used.
