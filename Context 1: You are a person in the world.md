## Context 1: You are a Person in the World.


##### What we know about what the State and Capital knows:
  - There is a set of Surveillance Technologies that are either legislated to be in place (Telecommunications, Metadata) or are compelled by corporate interest. These Surveillance Technologies affect everyone.

## State Metadata and Telecommunications Surveillance
  #### Metadata:
- **Your ISP must retain for two years:**

- **Account identification information:** The name, address, personal identification, billing and contract information, contact information, any related account, service or device information and status.

- **The source of a communication:** phone numbers, username, address, identifying number, email address, IP address and port number allocated to the device connected to the internet at the time of the communication. Any other identifier related to the source of communication.

- **The destination of a communication:** Phone number, IP address, email address or account and device identifier for multi-media communication such as VoIP, IM or video. Any other identifier related to the destination of communication.

- **The date, time and duration of a communication**.

- **The type of communication and relevant services used in connection with a communication.**

- **The location of device used in communication.**

- **IT IS NOT:** Your browsing history. Your real time location or the content of your communications.
However it is the source destination and IP addresses of your internet sessions.


#### Telecommunications Interception Act:
-  The real-time interception of telecommunications 'that are passing over a network' requires a warrant that will only be issued for the investigation of a serious offence that carries at least a 7 year prison sentence. Or the interception of a 'B-party' that is services likely to be used to communicate to a suspect.
  - **It permits the interception of conversation and messages in the form of speech, music, sound, data, text, images, videos and any combination of the above.**


- **Stored communications are email, sms or voice mail that have not commenced or have finished passing over the network**.
- It is only necessary to obtain a warrant if the intention is to access the stored communications in secret. The threshold of the warrant is investigation for an offence carrying a penalty of three years prison.
- The government has stated data retention is intended to be used for copy-rights violation.

## The Digital Distopia of Corporate Surveillance.

### Signing up to the Panopticon: Consenting to Corporate Surveillance: Two examples:
##### Facebook Collects:
  - Collects Messages, chat, pictures, all posts shared or otherwise, location data, photo location data, file and post metadata, what you look at on facebook, when and how long for.
  - Collects and corelates all instances of you on Facebook. Other peoples post and messages to you. When other people upload or sync you as a contact, or upload a picture of you, including the geo-location of that picture.
  - Collects information about the people and groups you are connected to and how you interact, who you talk to and how much, and all contact information from available devices.
  - All financial information shared with Facebook.
  - "We collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other decives where you install or access our services". We collate this data:
    - "Operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers."
    - "Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals."
    - "Connection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address."
  - Information from sites that use Facebook services, browsing history, app use, and information sharing arrangements between said sites and Facebook.
  - "We receive information about you and your activities on and off Facebook from third-party partners, such as information from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them."
  - Information from companies owned or operated by facebook in accordance with their terms and conditions. these companies include instagram, WhatsApp, Atlas (advertising company), Onavo (App company) and many others.

  - Facebook sells this information, uses it to target and monitor advertising, shares it with third parties, uses it for security and safety, Vendors and Customers of facebooks.


##### Twitter collects:
  - Personal information: name, username, password, email address, phone number which will be used for marketing and tracking.
  - Contacts that are synced will be used to target ads and suggesting connections to contacts.
  - Your location, your website, date of birth and pictures.
  - When and where you tweeted and the application you used to tweet.
  - creation time, language, country and time zone, lists you create, people you follow, Tweets you like or retweet.
  - Twitter shares analytical information with search engines, universities, public agencies. Twitter analyses your tweets to make inferences about personal data.
  - Direct messages are stored and processed including information relating to them.
  - Location data from device and GPS, information about your networks and IP address. This is used to customize and sell adverts to you.
  - How you interact with links accross the twitter networks.
  - Additional Web browsing information via cookies.
  - information about accessing any and all of their services including your IP, browser types, OS, referring web pages, pages visited, location, mobile carrier, device information, search terms. This information is logged and analysed and sold.
  - Twitter tracks you across the web and records your history for 30 days.
  - Twitter sells everything to advertising companies.
  - Twitter purchases information from Databrokers and shares aggregated information with its 'corporate affiliates'.


#### They sell you to each other: The Databroker.
- **Australian Example:**
  Woolworths bought a 50% stake in Data storage company Quantum in 2013, this has since grown to be worth around 200m. Quantum runs Woolworths data collection analysis and Personalizaiton programs. Quantum stores and aggregates data it then uses to creat targeted advertising campaigns specific to the businesses needs. Databrokers, like Quantum's, customers are the Corporate entities that seek to leverage data to influence our financial decisions, evaluate us as Customers (Woolworths, Coles, banks etc), predict our future wants (pregnancy, cars, hobbies), and protect against future risks (health insurers).

  - A general rule is if you are getting something cheaper or free through a program 'like flybuys, frequent fliers points etc' they are getting something too. Frequent flyer programs are leveraged for profit, including the personalizaiton of flight prices, targeted advertising, attempts at brand control etc. The danger and significance of the data sets do not come from the data that is being held by single corporate entities rather from the motivation to aggregate multiple data sets and monitor the effects on customers behaviour in real time.


- **Facebookâ€™s new ad targeting program** works with four data brokers: Axiom, Datalogix, Epsilon, and BlueKai. Companies who want to advertise on Facebook can use the data controlled by these data brokers to build custom groups and then show those groups targeted ads on Facebook. These different data brokers use different tracking strategies. BlueKai and facebook share cookie matching data that enables the monitoring of customers behaviour accross the net, while Axiom shares hashed credentials with Facebook and other customers that are then used to monitor behaviour and affects of targeted advertising.


- **There are government surveillance relationships to both data brokers and social networking sites**. These include the development of sophisticated social media surveillance programs that are able to automonomously aggregate and record social media posts for later investigation. This enables a faster access then accessing stored metadata or applying for Telecommunications Interception Warrants.


- **Spyware** is a term that has been coined for malware (malicious software) that monitors your behaviour online and tracks you activity accross the internets in an attempt to sell that information for profit. The clients of Spyware controllers are corporate entities like Databrokers or the suppliers of Databrokers.

### The internet is a unsafe Place.
- Beware the criminal hackerz: People are trying to make money out of compromising computer systems, seizing and stealing data and putting malicious programs onto a system. The most lucrative targets are corporate and state entities however they generally have better security then everyday people so we can become the target of malware that is in the wild and automated to target people. Criminal Hackerz are often state or corporate entities acting anonymously.

- Ransomware and other high level NSA cyber weapons developed for Cyberwar have been leaked onto the net due to state conflict and the breaching of the NSA by rival security agencies. These weapons have been monetized by other state actors. Wannacry, Bad Rabbit, notbadrabbit, Petya etc.

- When corporate data breaches occur the information for users is often released onto the internet. This leads to the construction of Password lists and the correlation of users data with other services. Programs can then be run to attempt compromise other acounts on other services. Similar programs can be used to attempt to brute force services based on password lists and behavioural tendencies. This is why you should not reuse passwords, you should use strong non-derivative passwords. Since even the strongest encryption is only as strong as the password. You should check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see what log in credentials of yours have been released and consider if you are using the same password email combinations still.
#(show have I been pwned screen shot of compromised emails)

- Some people do this for the lulz. There is not always a profit motive. It is easy to get caught up in it all.
