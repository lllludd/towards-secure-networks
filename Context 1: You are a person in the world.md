## Context 1: You are a Person in the World.


##### What we know about what the State and Capital knows:
  - There is a set of Surveillance Technologies that are either legislated to be in place (Telecommunications, Metadata) or are compelled by corporate interest. These Surveillance Technologies affect everyone.

## State Metadata and Telecommunications Surveillance
  #### Metadata:
- **Your ISP must retain for two years:**

- **Account identification information:** The name, address, personal identification, billing and contract information, contact information, any related account, service or device information and status.

- **The source of a communication:** phone numbers, username, address, identifying number, email address, IP address and port number allocated to the device connected to the internet at the time of the communication. Any other identifier related to the source of communication.

- **The destination of a communication:** Phone number, IP address, email address or account and device identifier for multi-media communication such as VoIP, IM or video. Any other identifier related to the destination of communication.

- **The date, time and duration of a communication**.

- **The type of communication and relevant services used in connection with a communication.**

- **The location of device used in communication.**

- **IT IS NOT:** Your browsing history. Your real time location or the content of your communications.
However it is the source destination and IP addresses of your internet sessions.


#### Telecommunications Interception Act:
-  The real-time interception of telecommunications 'that are passing over a network' requires a warrant that will only be issued for the investigation of a serious offence that carries at least a 7 year prison sentence. Or the interception of a 'B-party' that is services likely to be used to communicate to a suspect.
  - **It permits the interception of conversation and messages in the form of speech, music, sound, data, text, images, videos and any combination of the above.**


- **Stored communications are email, sms or voice mail that have not commenced or have finished passing over the network**.
- It is only necessary to obtain a warrant if the intention is to access the stored communications in secret. The threshold of the warrant is investigation for an offence carrying a penalty of three years prison.
- The government has stated data retention is intended to be used for copy-rights violation.
