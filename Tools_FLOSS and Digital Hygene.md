## Free, Libre, Open, Source, Software and Digital Hygene

#### UPDATE AND PATCH YOUR SYSTEM!
Basic:
- All built software and many hardware environments have bugs.
- These bugs are patched in a constant series of patches and changes. This is done in a series of disclosures and fixes that are then announced.
- After the fix is pushed through the vulnerability is disclosed. At this point everyone knows about the vulnerability.
- If you do not patch your system these known vulnerabilities are exploitable.
- The use of an undisclosed vulnerability like this is called 0-day exploit.
- There is a large amount of software that role is to ascertain the type and version of your software.
- If you do not patch your system it is vulnerability.

Advanced:
- Use software that is secure by design!
- Security starts at the hardware level. Hardware, firmware, software all build on each other. The deep

#### Get Software from known sources.
- Do not install anything on your system of which you do not trust the source!
- Do not download any unsolicited software from anywhere on the internet!!! If an untrusted site requires you to load software do not accept! Get it from a trusted source!
- Verifying the cryptographic signature of software ensures the software has not been modified by a third party. Use Sha256 or stronger, or use GPG key signification.

#### Closed Software vs Freedom loving Software.
- Open source software is open and free.
- The code is available to anyone who wants to look at it, to check for vulnerabilities, or to build their own version.
- Propriatery code is not available. It is only by reverse engineering and high level penatrasion testing that we can find issues with the code.
- Further to this many different vulnerabilities and intentional data leakages are considered to be features not bugs. They will not be fixed, but rather utilized by the codes owners.
