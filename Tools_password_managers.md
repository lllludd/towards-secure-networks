## Password Managers

#### Why fortify the weakest link?
- Strong encryption is strong. To try and break it is effectively impossible. To try and factor a 4096 bit RSA key a computer would require 120 Terabytes of RAM to even attempt it. We can rest relatively assured (until Quantuum computing).
- This means the password will almost always be the weakest link

#### Reusing passwords.
- Passwords are hard to remember. Strong passwords should consist of at least 20 characters and not be comprised of personal known or public data.
- Passwords should also not be re-used. Because while your security might be tight, corporate and service providers data is commonly breached and with it your credentials.  This information is released into the wild and if you repeat your passwords the attackers already have them.
- All of this adds together to mean you need many long and hard to guess passwords. If you follow these rules you will soon have dozens of passwords to remember. No one expects this, use a password manager.

#### Generating passwords and remembering them for you? You have no excuse.
- Password managers are encrypted vaults that protect your passwords. You are only required to remember one long password to unlock it.
- Password managers can generate either Diceware or ASCII character passwords of a set length so you do not need to try and come up with something random.
- The number one thing people should do for Security is use password managers and strong passwords.

#### What one to use?
- Lastpass (closed code)
- Keepassxc (open source)
- 1passwrd (paid service)

#### What attacks does this protect me from?  
- Brute forcing (the use of computer programs to guess your password).
- Password and credential matching. (the use of data leaks to match your login details on other services)
