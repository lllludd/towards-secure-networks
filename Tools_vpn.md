## Virtual Private Network

#### What is it?
- Without a VPN your ISP can see everything you do online. This gives your ISP endless control over your connection, the ability to insert adverts, censor sites, restrict content and monitor you. Unless HTTPS/TLS/SSL is used, then your ISP can only see what website you access.
- VPN's protect you from this by constructing an encrypted connection between your computer and one of the VPN's servers. This protects your web content and traffic from tampering by your ISP, it also prevents your ISP's ability to monitor your internet activity.
- The same risks exist and the same protection are afforded by a VPN when you use public wifi or unknown networks.
- The tracking protection also works from the other end of the connection. Not only is your ISP (and metadata) prevented from monitoring your web traffic, but websites and trackers are prevented from ascertaining your IP address.
- Most VPN's have multiple servers allowing you to use the most practicable point of entry into the public internet. (netflix, etc.)

#### You get what you pay for. Be careful who you enter into business with.
- There are risks associated with VPN's. In the same way we need to be discerning when we give access to our data or trust certain web services, we must be discerning with our choice of VPN provider.
- Many free VPN providers leverage their user base by selling their data and internet activity to Databrokers to make a profit. A VPN has the same access to your internet traffic as your ISP would otherwise.
- VPN's are potentially susceptible to government surveillance pressure. You must choose carefuly where your VPN is based what laws the VPN is liable to obey and what information or 'logs' the VPN maintains.
- The VPN's entire reputation and customer base should be based on providing a safe, secure, fast, privacy focused service. If this is not their business model the liability they have for not providing it is lessend. Go with the people whose reputation is supporting them and vouched for.

#### What should I use then?
- Try and choose reputable vpn who is politically on our side. They should support OpenVpn and not require any personal identifying information to register, including the ability to pay with crypto currency etc.
- VPNarea.com : Is based in Bulgaria and required to keep no logs, with servers around the world. Is fast and reputed to be private and secure.
- https://thatoneprivacysite.net/ has a comparison of heaps of services.

#### What attacks does this protect me from?
- Metadata retention.
- Insecure public networks.
- Some forms of website side tracking.

#### What does this **not** do?
- Anonymize your access to known services, such as facebook, your bank, your employment place etc.
- Hide the fact you are using a VPN. Your ISP can see that you are using a VPN.
- Protect from Website based tracking methods, such as browsers fingerprint, cookie matching and other spieware or malware on your machine.
- Maximise your internet connection speed.
