## TOR

#### The Onion Router: the crown jewel of online privacy.
- Tor is a series of volunteer operated servers that enable a user to route their internet traffic through a series of encrypted connections.
- A Tor connection consists of an encrypted connection between the users computer and an entry node in the tor network. The users connection is then routed twice more, through encrypted connections to other Tor servers, to an exit node in the Tor network. At which point a non-encrypted connection is established to the site or service you are trying to access in the public internet. The site or service's responce to you is then routed back through the same Tor connections.

#### What does it do for us?
- Tor's job is to protect the transport of data over the internet. By doing so inconjunction with behavioural adjustments we can become anonymous.
- Tor has a broad user base: cops, cypherpunks, military, journalist, whistleblowers, abuse survivors seeking support groups without exposure, illness suffers who need to protect their information from insurers and other malicious parties, activists who need to communicate safetly etc.
- Tor offers more protection then a VPN. It is configured to not rely or trust in a single commercial interest,
- Tor protect against metadata retention, some forms of communication interception, some forms of website tracking.

#### What does it not do?
- Tor does not anonymize your access to personally identifying services like facebook, or your bank, it does however strip some location data from your access.
- Tor protects against some forms of tracking but does not protect against certain other forms, Tor Browser or TAILS however is configured to protect against more of these such as Browser fingerprinting, hardware matching etc.
- Tor does not protect against timing attacks. Timing attacks are the monitoring of the Tor network to determine pattern matching between data entering and exiting the network. This is incredibly difficult and expensive in theory as a huge amount of data would have to be monitored.
- Tor does not prevent you from identifying yourself by the data you send to sites, services and communication additional protection will be needed to prevent some data being accessed.

Tor is awesome and some of the crew who develop and maintain it are amazing too.
